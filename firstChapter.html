                There was once a little kid who lived at the edge of a village with his parents. His father was part of a group of explorers that got wither sickness from a flower during one of their trips. These explorers werenâ€™t aware of it until the father hugged his little kid, causing the sickness to spread to the little kid. Luckily, it was only able to spread up to his arm thanks to the father noticing quickly. Ironically, the medicine to slow down the sickness from spreading throughout the whole body was by a stew from a yellow flower. This was discovered by a few experiments done trying to find a cure for the sickness. Thanks to this discovery, the father and his little boy would drink the stew 3 to 4 times per week.
