                A few months passed by, the boy and little chicken had gotten closer, having passed through many trials together, they enjoyed each otherâ€™s company. Then suddenly on one particular night, while they were eating, the chicken went under a magical transformation (cue in sailor moon transformation), there was a bright light that blinded the boy for a bit. When he regained his eyesight, what he saw greatly surprised him. The chicken that used to be in front of him had turned into an adorable girl. The only reason he was able to recognize her was because of the little streak of blue hair she had. Unexpectedly, she had no clothes on, so the boy flustered quickly got a change of clothes for her. Once she got her clothes on, she kept on yapping, excited they could finally communicate properly. The boy was happy they could also communicate properly now, it was quite comical trying to communicate with a chicken.
