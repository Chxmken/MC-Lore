                He started feeling scared and hungry, haven't eaten for almost the whole day. Suddenly, a little wild chicken appeared out of nowhere, slowly getting closer to the boy, startling him a bit. When he took a closer look at the chicken, he noticed it had a bright blue feather on the top of its head, its feathers looking very fluffy, making the chicken look very cute. At that moment, the boy’s hunger took over, and so he started chasing the chicken to capture it and make a delicious meal out of it. The chicken, realizing his thoughts by the way he looked at it and the way he started chasing it, started running trying to get away from him. And so for the next couple of minutes, the boy chased the chicken trying to catch it, meanwhile the chicken ran for its life so it wouldn’t get captured, because even if we can’t tell, chickens have feelings too. And this particular chicken didn’t want to get eaten, so it came up with an idea, to lure the boy into a little area where mushrooms could be found.
