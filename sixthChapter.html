                The boy, having chased the chicken for a while, was about to give up on the chase until he suddenly ran into a little open field with mushrooms. He looked at the chicken in disbelief, and the chicken looked back at him with an expectant look, implying that since the chicken led it all the way here, he should give up on the idea of cooking and eating it. He decided that since there was another source of food, he would forget about trying to cook the chicken. He immediately started a fire to prepare some mushroom stew, as he was preparing it, the little chicken grew curious and started to get closer to the boy. He figured there were enough mushrooms for him to eat and have some leftovers so he grabbed one of the bowls he took with him and gave a bit of the mushroom stew to the little chicken to try it out. The little chicken got closer upon seeing the boy placing down the bowl for it.
