                Some years later, the little boy became a teenager, and one day, the village chief made him go out into the woods to forage some mushrooms for a stew and some other things they needed. The teenage boy went into the woods to grab what he needed and got distracted by his surroundings and the beautiful scenery, causing him to lose track of time. By the time he realized he had lost track of time, the sun was starting to set, so he quickly made sure he had everything he needed and made his way back to the village. Once he got back to the village, he saw it was completely destroyed. There were signs that a group of barbarians had attacked and looted the village. There was fire everywhere, the once tall and beautiful houses were now destroyed and in tatters. Bits and pieces of rubble were found all over the once pretty village. The boy looked at the ruined village in horror, dashing to where his now destroyed home was, hoping his family was safeâ€¦ hoping they were still alive.
