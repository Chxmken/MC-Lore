                When he arrived at his home, he saw how destroyed it was, there was barely any of the roof left, the second floor was in tatters, huge pieces of the roof were on the floor, crushing some items, broken walls, pieces of glass on the floor, destroyed furniture, some items were on fire, it was a mess. The first floor was in a slightly better condition than the second floor and the roof, at least the walls were still intact. The boy checked for any signs of his family being alive, but to no avail. The last place he needed to check was the basement, where they would store everything, essentially being more of a storage room. And so the boy went down the basement only to discover that there was close to nothing left. The barbarians had looted almost everything that was in the storage room, leaving only the items they deemed unnecessary, including the little stash of yellow flowers they had and his father’s little workspace area where he would create the medicine stew. The boy didn’t see any signs of his family, alive or dead, so he could only hope they managed to escape to safety away from this place.
